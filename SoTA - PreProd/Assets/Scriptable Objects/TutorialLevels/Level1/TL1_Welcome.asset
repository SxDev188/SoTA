  dialogueInfo:
  - dialouge: "Welcome to the Abyss! \nThis tutorial level will introduce you to
      a couple of basic puzzle objects and player abilities."
  - dialouge: You move around using the W, A, S and D keys on your keyboard, or if
      using a gamepad the Left Stick.
  - dialouge: What you just interacted with is a lore tile, and they will give you
      useful tips and hints, or as the name indicates some lore.
  - dialouge: The glowing object on top of you is a Star.
  - dialouge: 'The Star is keeping you alive in this dark abyssmal place, so make
      sure to not leave it laying around for too long, or you''ll die! '
  - dialouge: The glow from the Star also reveals color, so you can see color connections
      between objects.
  - dialouge: "You can drop the Star by pressing the space bar on your keyboard,
      or the North button on your gamepad. \nYou can also recall the Star to you
      in the same way if you are close enough."
  - dialouge: 'You can also throw the Star to interact with things.

      Press
      the Left Mouse Button, aim by pulling the mouse back, and release to throw.

      With
      a gamepad, aim with the Right Stick and push the Right Trigger to throw.'
  - dialouge: Every time you throw the Star, your progress will be saved. So if you
      do end up dying, you will revert back to the last time you threw the Star.
